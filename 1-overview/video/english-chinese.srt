00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,000
During the summer between case at cleveland and caltech at pasadena
暑假，在Cleveland的Case(凯斯理工学院)和Pasadena的Caltech(加州理工学院)之间

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,180
i had a summer job
我有了一个暑假工

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,080
writing compilers this algebraic
写一个编译器

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,127
this is the software that converts algebraic language into machine language 
这是一个将代数语言转换为机器语言的软件

5
00:00:16,127 --> 00:00:19,562
um i had a job writing compiler for Burroughs Corporation 
我有了一个工作，为Burroughs Corporation写一个编译器

6
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:22,291
Burroughs was headquartered in Pasadena you know  
Burroughs 总部在Pasadena

7
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:29,784
I mean the Burroughs division that was dealing with software was headquartered in pasadena
意思是Burroughs有划分，负责软件处理的总部设在Pasadena

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,080
And Case had recently installed a burroughs computer that i liked very much during my senior year
那时Case装了一台Burroughs计算机，我大四的时候非常喜欢它

9
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,320
some people from Thompson Rainbow Wooldridge approached me and said
一些来自Thompson Rainbow Wooldridge的人过来跟我说

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,800
Don, we understand that you can write compilers  
Don，我们知道你可以写编译器

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,160
um we're going to put in a proposal to Burroughs to write a compiler for their machine  
我们准备和Burrough商量，为他们的Burroughs 205机器写一个编译器

12
00:00:52,160 --> 00:01:00,088
the Burroughs 205 for language called Algol which was just being invented at that time  
给当时刚被发明出的Algol语言

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:07,280
the algorithmic language and international standard that was supposed to replace FORTRAN
这个代数语言和国际标准要替代当时最流行的FORTRAN语言

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,893
the most popular language at the time 

15
00:01:09,893 --> 00:01:14,080
and so Thompson Rainbow Woolders made a proposal to Burroughs for
因此Thompson Rainbow Wooldridge向Burroughs提出了协议

16
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:22,072
I believe it was seventy thousand dollars to create a Algol compiler for the Burroughs 205.  
我认为是要7万美元来给Burroughs 205写一个Algol编译器。

17
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,880
the people who made this proposal really though were clueless about how to write compilers
虽然他们不知道如何编写编译器

18
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:35,040
so they hired me as a Case senior to do the job because they'd heard that i knew how to do it
所以他们雇用我这个Case的大四生做这项工作，因为他们听说我知道怎么做

19
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,919
and i had done this runsable and a couple of versions of other software at Case
并且我在Case已经做出过能跑的多个版本

20
00:01:42,177 --> 00:01:49,040
spring of my senior year that they are showing me about this machine that bros had
大四的春天 ，他们让我看了这个机器

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,640
and i started playing around with the computer and i got interested  in
我开始使用这个电脑并且对这个项目很感兴趣

22
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,120
the project, but Burroughs turned them down they didn't give them the contract  
但是Burroughs拒绝了他们的合同，没达成协议

23
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,440
so after Burroughs said they weren't going to do it with Thompson Rainbow Wooldridge i said  
在Burroughs说他们不会和Thompson Rainbow Wooldridge合作

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,840
well wait a minute, maybe i'll write to Burroughs on my own and i sent him a letter and  
我说也许我可以自己写一个给Burroughs，然后我写了一封信

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:15,120
said, you know for five thousand dollars i can write you another compiler  
说我可以写一个编译器，要五千美元

26
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,831
five thousanddollars was a huge amount of money in 1959, in 1960 
1960年，5k美元是一笔巨款

27
00:02:19,972 --> 00:02:30,447
i mean a college professor was making eight thousand dollars a year or something like this.
当时一个大学教授每年能赚大概八千美元

28
00:02:31,607 --> 00:02:41,520
 i thought five thousand dollars was incredibly rich thing, you know to do. I said to Burroughs
五千美元的工作是一件报酬相当高的工作

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:47,360
 i can do it in the summer except i won't have time to implement all of this Algol. I'll be able to  
我给Burroughs说，我可以在夏天完成它，但我没时间给Algol实现所有的东西

30
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,560
do everything except procedures. i'll be able to which is actually the hardest thing to do in the  compiler 
我可以做除了procedures的所有事情，我来写编译器实际中最难的subroutines， 来扩展语言的能力

31
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:01,040
which is the subroutines the ability to extend the language. Well, they wrote back saying  
最难的subroutines， 来扩展语言的能力。然而他们回信说

32
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,360
we can't have Algol without procedures. You got to put procedures in too and so i thought about  
我们不能没有procedures，你也得写它

33
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,960
it and figured out oh yeah okay i see how i can do it but you'll have to pay me fifty  
思考后，我说我知道怎么做了，但是您得付我55K美元

34
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:18,400
five hundred dollars instead of five thousand, so they said okay, so i spent the summer of 1960  
而不是50K，然后他们说Okay，

35
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:27,200
that's after graduating from Case. I spent the summer writing this compiler for Algol for the  
1960年，我从Case毕业后，花了整个夏天为Burroughs 205和Alogol编写了编译器

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:36,640
Burroughs 205 and i wrote it but really i had it only in pencil and paper i  
但实际上我只用铅笔写在了纸上还没能实际跑

37
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,800
didn't have it ready to go and i and then i would take it with me on as  

38
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:48,880
i went out to Pasadena, and work on it there when i was at the burroughs plant in pasadena  
我将带着它去Pasadena，并在那里工作

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:58,720
um so on my way out west, uh, i had a little volkswagen that might gotten from my parents and i  
在我向西行驶的路上，我开着从我父母那里得到的一辆大众汽车

40
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:07,040
drove 100 miles a day and got a motel and sat down and wrote software. uh and took 30  
我每天开车100英里，并在汽车旅馆坐下来写代码、写软件

41
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:13,280
days to drive from milwaukee to uh to Pasadena. every day writing a little bit of this software  
从Milwaukee到Pasadena花了30 天，每天都写一点这个软件

42
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,760
then i got to Pasadena and had all my code had all my notes and started putting it onto
当我到了Pasadena，把所有的代码和笔记开始放到打孔卡上调试

43
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,480
punch cards and you know debugging it. And by christmas time i had their compiler for them and  
打孔卡上调试。到圣诞节的时候，我有了给他们的编译器

44
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,760
and it was a machine that didn't sell very well so there weren't too many places in the 
那种机器的销量不佳，所以世界上没有太多地方用

45
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:36,000
world. but i heard for the next 10 years that people in brazil were still using it a lot and so  
但是我听说在接下来的十年里，巴西的人们仍在大量使用它

46
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,240
it was an interesting experience for me but the most important from my point of view was  
它是对我来说是一次有趣的经历，但从我的角度来看，最重要的是

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:53,440
i had 5 500 dollars, which was enough to get married. so in the summer of 61 Jill and i got married  
我有了5500，足够我结婚用了 ， 所以在61年的夏天，我结婚了

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,240
and it paid for our honeymoon trip in Europe which was our first time seeing the world
它支付了我们在欧洲的蜜月旅行，这是我们第一次见识这个世界
